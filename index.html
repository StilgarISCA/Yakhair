		<h2>Why Yakhair?</h2>
		<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/yak-head.jpg" alt="Yak head">Every time I give out my email address, people always have a chuckle over my domain name and then they ask about it. Unique domain names were difficult to come by even back in 2001. When trying to come up with a good name, I was reminded of a recent trip where I saw a wig store sign advertising yak hair wigs. You can figure out the rest.</p>
